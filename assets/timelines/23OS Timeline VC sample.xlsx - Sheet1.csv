Recruitment,Recruit TRC Chair ,Chamber Staff,"Outside of the decision to conduct a TRC, the decision of who your chair will be is the most important decision you will make throughout the TRC. When thinking about possible chairs, think about those BUSINESS leaders in your community who are known for their ability to get things done. These individuals are well-known and well-respected. If one of these people made a call to a business leader in town, the call would always be immediately accepted. Typically the President & CEO of their company, the Chair is someone with a strong business reputation.

The selling points that can be used when approaching a potential chair include the lasting impact a TRC will have on the chamber’s program of work and finances as well as the ability a TRC will give the chamber to reach a greater number of businesses within the community.

The chair is desired because of the credence their involvement lends to the campaign. The amount of time this will require of them is limited. From start to finish, their total time involved is typically only about 20 hours from when they accept the position to the campaign’s conclusion.

Make sure to discuss your thoughts of potential TRC chair candidates with YGM staff before making an invitation to a potential TRC candidate."
Recruitment,Send calendar invites to Chair ,Chamber Staff,Secure the contact information for the Chair (and their Executive Assistants) and send them calendar invitations for each of the TRC trainings & sessions. Reiterate which meetings they are must attend and which meetings their attendance is requested.
Recruitment,Identify prospective campaign participants ,Chamber Staff,"Staff will need to compile a list of the companies that serve as the chamber’s largest investors, Board member companies, and those companies which are typically involved in chamber community projects. As you are receiving your leadership names, you’ll want to make certain that those companies are represented. If you notice some companies are not represented, you’ll want to suggest a representative from those companies as a volunteer or team captain. Do not push your own set of volunteers, however. This list is only to be used as a supplement for the names your leadership provides. The goal is to have new volunteers in the TRC and thus, expand your reach into the community. The TRC is based on relationships, and those cannot be forced. "
Incentives-Trip,Complete trip research ,Chamber Staff,"The campaign trip is a critical component of the campaign. You will need a destination that is affordable but also motivating to volunteers. Typically, a good TRC trip is no more than a four-day, three-night trip. Spring TRCs should schedule a trip between September and November while Fall TRCs should schedule their trips between January and April of the following year.

The guaranteed number and names of travelers will not be known until after the campaign concludes. YGM will provide you with a recommendation of how much you should plan to spend per person to align with the YGM TRC expense guidelines. The trip destination and dates will be announced to volunteers during training.

If you have a member business that is a travel agency, use that business to assist with trip planning."
TRC Management,Develop TRC theme,Chamber Staff,"A Total Resource Campaign is fun! And a theme can help you make it fun, both for you and your volunteers. You can use a theme to develop a logo and decorations for Opening and Rally Sessions along with your Victory Party. And you can play on it throughout the TRC.

Your TRC theme increases the engagement of your volunteers and should be created with them in mind. Many like to promote the trip with their theme. Others use a high-profile Chamber or community issue. The TRC theme should be volunteer-centric, not member-centric.

It is not, however, required that you have a theme. You can still have fun and still do fun activities without one, overarching theme. Do what makes the most sense for you and your chamber.

Access YGM's list of theme and logo examples in the Resource portal to get your creative juices following."
TRC Management,Develop TRC logo ,Chamber Staff,"If you decided to use a theme for your TRC, you will need to create a logo for your volunteers to associate with your campaign. Be thoughtful as you design the logo as it will represent the chamber and the TRC, and you want it to be a positive reflection of both.

If you do not have internal resources to develop a logo, look to your membership roster to see if you have a marketing firm or local company with a graphic design staffer which could assist with the creation of your logo.

Access YGM's list of theme and logo examples in the Resource portal to get your creative juices following."
TRC Events,Conduct Opening Session planning meeting ,Chamber Staff,"The Opening Session is arguably the most important of all your TRC events. The energy and momentum for the TRC begins at the Opening Session. This is the first time all your leadership and volunteers are in one room together. There will be a feeling of excitement and competition as the team goals are announced. You will want all your leadership present and visible for this Session.

At the meeting, you will assign tasks to each member of your team (for instance, your events coordinator, communications director, RSVP specialists, etc.) and discuss the goals for the Opening Session.

When planning the Opening Session, remember it main purpose is to serve as a working session for your teams. They will need to develop and announce their team goal. You will want some type of visual, graphic display on which you can chart each goal as it is announced. This will allow everyone to see your progress toward your overall goal as each team goal is announced.

Be sure to refer to the Opening Session Tool Kit in the Resource portal for additional tips on how to make this a fantastic event for everyone. "
TRC Management,Reserve facilities for campaign events ,Chamber Staff,"Many of your TRC events will require some advance planning, especially because you will need to book the proper facilities. The campaign volunteer training sessions are often best if held at the chamber offices if there is a board or meeting room that can accommodate approximately half the volunteers in a classroom style format. This makes it easier for staff to manage the logistics of training.

For the Opening Session, you’ll need something that is large enough to hold all your leadership and volunteers. That location will also need to allow for a working session with teams determining goals and for goal announcements. Remember, this will be the most important session of the campaign. Plan this location accordingly.

For the Victory Party, you can plan it with a Business After Hours format. These do well in unique locations such as airport hangars, outdoor amphitheaters, zoos, atriums, and fire departments. These are often the least attended sessions, so a fun environment will increase your attendance.

Your weekly Rally Sessions are often held at lunch and can be held in the chamber offices, local restaurant meeting rooms or meeting rooms of member businesses. You will simply want to make sure the space is large enough to hold everyone comfortably and allow for any moving around you have planned for that Session. Plan to keep these sessions fun and informative.

Once you have thought through where you want to have these sessions, go ahead and book the locations.

Be sure to refer to the specific event Tool Kits in the Resource portal for additional logistical information and details."
Recruitment,Recruit Vice Chairs ,Chair,"The key role of the campaign Chair is to recruit their Vice Chairs who assist with leadership recruitment. Vice Chairs are business leaders who have significant contacts in the BUSINESS community and can enlist fellow CEOs to commit a team of volunteers. Each Vice Chair should recruit three to six teams (a specific number will be decided closer to the Vice Chair Training date). The Chair will then stay in contact with the Vice Chairs throughout the campaign to encourage and motivate them, just as the Vice Chairs will encourage and motivate their teams. "
TRC Management,Finalize campaign goals ,"YGM, Chamber Staff, Chair","YGM will have conversations with the Chamber CEO and the TRC Chair to determine the TRC goal. The goal will be based on how much in sponsorships is anticipated to be raised, the amount of sponsorship inventory created, the quality of volunteers recruited, and other factors. You will be communicating this goal – and your progress toward it – often."
Trainings,Hold Vice Chair Training ,"YGM, Chamber Staff, Chair","A YGM representative will be on-site with your chamber and train your Vice Chairs on the TRC timeline as well as on the specifics of the Vice Chair role.

Vice Chair Training will cover such topics as:
•	Details of the Campaign
•	Campaign goals
•	Strategies for working with the companies they feel would make great teams
•	Various types of Team Captains

Vice Chairs will also learn the different types of teams – business and community – and how to make different asks to different types of team leaders. "
TRC Management,Send calendar invites to Vice Chairs ,Chamber Staff,Secure the contact information for the Chair (and their Executive Assistants) and send them calendar invitations for each of the TRC trainings & sessions. Reiterate which meetings they are requested to attend.
TRC Management,Seek TRC event sponsors ,Chamber Staff,"The first sponsorships you should sell is for the TRC itself. The companies that sponsor the TRC will have the ability to be seen throughout the campaign and have its logo associated with the campaign and all its events. The funds raised from these sponsorships will assist in offsetting the costs of the TRC events.

Offer these sponsorships to your Chair and Vice Chairs for their own companies first. Then allow the Team Captains to sell the remaining ones. Once these sponsorships are sold, it allows you to have a sales boost immediately when the campaign begins, and it allows those purchasing companies to be in front of the leadership and volunteers as soon as the campaign begins. "
MarComm,Begin announcing TRC to membership ,Chamber Staff,"You can never begin talking about your TRC too early. This should ideally be a brief notice about the upcoming campaign. The primary message should be preparing your members for the campaign itself and the benefits the campaign will provide them. Reinforce that the TRC will provide reciprocal benefits.

Be sure to focus on the leadership structure of the campaign, especially on the chair. You selected the chair specifically so the business community would take note of the stature of that individual. Use that to draw people’s interest to the TRC.

Access YGM Dropbox Shared Folder to access the Communications Toolkit where you'll find detailed information and examples on how to announce the campaign."
Recruitment,Finalize Team Captain list ,Chamber Staff,"This is a crucial step. Our experience shows that you haven’t really secured your Team Captains until you have their names and contact information. Have your Vice Chairs provide you with their Team Captains as they receive those confirmations rather than holding them all until the end. Notify each Team Captain of the Team Captain Training and then send another reminder as the event draws closer. This meeting will be valuable for them as we will discuss how to recruit the right type of volunteer.

Be sure to enter the Team Captain information into the YGM Online System as you receive their information (name, company, and email address) as both volunteers and in the Teams section. You will secure additional information from them at the Team Captain Training. "
TRC Management,Prepare leads list ,Chamber Staff,"This list will prove vital for quick access to important information during the campaign, especially during Rally Sessions and with individual volunteer interaction. This quick access will ease the workload for the TRC Coordinator. You will want to compile a list of all the sponsorships sold in the last two years, along with the amount of the sponsorship and the name of the purchasing company. This list should be easily accessible by the campaign staff."
TRC Management,Complete product development ,Chamber Staff,"All sponsorships must be fully comprised with complete descriptions, prices, and benefits. Make sure you have final approval from all chamber department heads and from the Chamber CEO/President."
Incentives-Trip,Finalize incentive structure ,"YGM, Chamber Staff",YGM will provide you with a suggested incentive structure – crafted specifically for your chamber and TRC – which you will need to have reviewed and approved by key chamber staff and your CEO/President. This will include the campaign trip. Staying very close to the time-tested structure suggested by YGM will help ensure success and contain costs.
MarComm,Create a closed TRC facebook group,Chamber Staff,"You will invite all your TRC volunteers to join a closed Facebook group created just for this TRC, but first you’ll use the group to provide a platform for Team Captains to share their recruiting efforts.

During the campaign, this platform will provide a good way to push information to your volunteers and to encourage them to engage with one another. You will be able to encourage competitions between the volunteers and between teams, and you can share photos within the group. We see lots of good competition spring up naturally between the volunteers in groups like these. "
Trainings,Hold Team Captain Training ,"YGM, Chamber Staff, Chair","Team Captains are the people who will be in direct contact with your volunteers on a regular basis. You will want them to be well versed in motivational strategies. They will also need to know as much as possible about the details of the campaign. The Team Captain Training will provide them with information which will get them ready to lead their teams to success.

The meeting will focus on helping Team Captains understand what type of individual will make a good volunteer and how best to recruit and motivate these individuals. This training will be a one-hour meeting. "
TRC Management,Send calendar invites to Team Captains ,Chamber Staff,Send the Team Captains calendar invitations for each of the TRC trainings & sessions. Reiterate which meetings they are requested to attend.
TRC Management,Discuss accounting & invoicing systems ,Chamber Staff,"YGM will meet with the TRC Coordinator and any other staff members who will be part of the contract entering and billing portion of the campaign. They will go over the processes that will be used to enter the contract, log the sale, invoice the sale, and cross-reference those items in their current database and financial software systems (i.e., ChamberMaster, Weblink, Quickbooks, etc.). It’s about using the tools located in the YGM online system and merging them with your current operating systems."
Recruitment,Send team thank you letters ,Chamber Staff,"For those companies that field an entire team of volunteers, including a Team Captain, send a letter to the CEO/business owner thanking them for supporting the chamber and the TRC. "
MarComm,Send gift solicitation letter ,Chamber Staff,You will be creating specific contests throughout the campaign to encourage and motivate your volunteers to both sell more and to sell specific products. Reach out to your member businesses and encourage them to contribute items that may be used as these prizes. This is an excellent opportunity for businesses to get their names in front of a large group of active business volunteers.  The letter provides an additional method of informing the membership about the TRC.  Send the following letter to your entire membership.
TRC Events,Confirm Opening Session agenda ,Chamber Staff,"In your Opening Session Toolkit, there is a sample agenda. You may review that to give you ideas for what you might want to include in your own agenda, but there are a few key things you will want to remember.
•	Keep the total time to one hour.
•	Make the event your own. Make it reflect YOUR chamber personality.
•	This is to generate excitement for the TRC and to motivate and energize volunteers.
•	Encourage competition.

You will want most of all to highlight the announcement of team goals. Make it a big deal. Make it fun. Make it a spectacle in the best possible way. If done well, you will generate competition and goals will be raised along the way."
MarComm,Send TRC media announcement ,Chamber Staff,"Approximately two weeks prior to your Opening Session (not long after your Team Captain Training), submit your TRC Announcement to your local media. Send it to your local newspaper, television station(s), radio station(s), and online media outlets. If you have a specific contact at any of the media outlets, send it to that individual.

Include the announcement in any online communications you have at the chamber – send a stand-alone electronic newsletter, for example – and place on your chamber website and promote on your social platforms. "
TRC Events,Send Opening Session invitations ,Chamber Staff,"Remember the Opening Session will set the tone for your entire campaign. You’ll want to invite everyone – your Chair, Vice Chairs, Team Captains, Board of Directors, Campaign Sponsors, volunteers – and will want your invitation to make an impression. If you are using a TRC theme/logo, be sure to use it prominently in your invitation design.

You may have your invitations printed and sent via mail or design them and send them via email. There are several websites which will send them. Some of those (by no means an exhaustive list) include: GreenVelope (https://www.greenvelope.com/), Evite (https://www.evite.com/), and Paperless Post (https:paperlesspost.com). "
TRC Management,Prepare training manuals ,Chamber Staff,"YGM will develop a customized Volunteer Training Manual for you from the Customization Form you completed. Additionally, the sponsorship inventory list and a complete membership roster will be included.  Each volunteer will need their own training manual. Volunteers will also need to complete a W9 IRS form so you can send then a 1099 if their earnings exceed $600. "
TRC Management,Prepare sponsorship supporting materials ,Chamber Staff,"The easier it is for sponsors to envision what they are sponsoring, the more likely it will be for them to buy into a Chamber program.  Utilize the sponsorship description in the Online System to upload videos and pictures of each program, initiative and event.

Additionally, you might want to make some of your chamber marketing materials available to your volunteers, so they have tangible items ready to show prospective sponsors. These do not need to be newly created materials. You likely already have flyers for your events or publications highlighting various initiatives. Make those available either on your website or in a Dropbox folder or in a Google Drive storage for volunteers to access and show potential sponsors to best describe what they are selling. "
Recruitment,Finalize Volunteer roster ,Chamber Staff,"This is a crucial list. Our experience shows that you haven’t really secured your Volunteers until you have their names and contact information.

Trainings,Send Volunteer Training announcements ,Chamber Staff,"As you receive each volunteer’s name and contact information, send an email welcoming them to the TRC. Provide information about the Volunteer Training sessions, including the dates and times. Request the volunteers RSVP for one session. You may want to send another group email to everyone reminding them of the session options and that they will need to select one session to attend and RSVP for that session. "
Trainings,"Hold a Vice Chair-Team Captain Meeting, if needed ","Chair, Chamber Staff","If you have not received an adequate response from your Team Captains on the day your Volunteer rosters are to have been secured, your Chair will need to call a Vice Chair-Team Captain meeting to rally the troops and to remind them of the importance of securing the needed volunteers. Your chair will again explain the reasoning behind the number of volunteers needed to ensure the TRC success. This meeting will ideally be held three to four days prior to Volunteer Training for Team Captains to have enough time to secure additional volunteers. "
MarComm,Add TRC link to Chamber homepage ,Chamber Staff,"You’ll want to have your dedicated TRC page with campaign and volunteer information available on your website prior to the campaign Volunteer Training and Opening Session.  On your Chamber homepage add a link to your YGM TRC page so your volunteers can access your unique TRC website that YGM is providing to you, but it is vital that you NOT link to your YGM TRC page until Volunteer Training. Once that link is live, sales may officially begin.  DO NOT make the link live BEFORE Volunteer Training."
Trainings,Hold Volunteer Training sessions ,"YGM, Chamber Staff",These will be information-packed two-hour sessions.

TRC Events,Generate excitement for Opening Session ,Chamber Staff,"The day prior to the Opening Session, call each of the volunteers with a reminder of the event. Be excited yourself when you call! The volunteers will hear and feed off your energy. Remember, this call is not to secure RSVP counts for food (while those do assist with a more accurate number). This activity is a gentle reminder of the meeting with a ""hope to see you there"" - not a ""we are about to order food; are you coming?"".

This is to build on the relationships during the campaign. You want the volunteers to begin to associate your voice with the campaign and with the energy and excitement that go with it. Higher energy leads to higher participation and higher participation leads to higher sales. "
TRC Events,Hold Opening Session ,"Chair, ALL Chamber Staff","This event will set the tone for your TRC. It is vital for the success of your campaign. You want this to be a high energy, fun event during which the volunteers and teams engage in friendly competition and become personally vested in the outcome of the campaign.

One particular item to remember is to record each team’s goal so you can post it on your YGM TRC page. This way, each team can check that page and see how their team is performing against the other teams. It’s an easy way to build competition. "
TRC Management,Print Rewards Report & incentive checks ,Chamber Staff,Print the Rewards Report from the YGM online system.

These should be crafted in such a way as to make your volunteers feel as if they would be missing out if they didn’t attend, not as if they would be scolded for missing. These are encouraged but not required. We want your volunteers to enjoy attending Rally Sessions and to leave feeling as if they have learned something new and gained valuable information to help their personal TRC sales.

You might consider making personal phone calls to each volunteer in addition to the emails. Our history shows ‘voice interaction’ increases responses and attendance. And higher participation at Rally Sessions equals higher sales."
TRC Events,Hold Rally Session #1,"Chair, Chamber Staff","Rally Sessions are integral to the success of your TRC. These weekly gatherings are what will ensure your volunteers maintain that initial motivation. Your use of motivational speakers, rewards, contests, lead generation, and fun will keep your volunteers returning each week. Be sure to respect their time and keep the sessions to an hour.

TRC Events,Hold Rally Session #5,"Chair, Chamber Staff","Rally Sessions are integral to the success of your TRC. These weekly gatherings are what will ensure your volunteers maintain that initial motivation. Your use of motivational speakers, rewards, contests, lead generation, and fun will keep your volunteers returning each week. Be sure to respect their time and keep the sessions to an hour.

Include games, team building, and competition in your weekly Rally Sessions. You’ll find those volunteers who attend will leave re-energized, and sales will typically be higher the afternoon of a Rally Session."
MarComm,Email TRC newsletter #5,Chamber Staff,"You’ll want to create a TRC newsletter just for the campaign. You’ll be sending it to everyone involved in the TRC and to your Board of Directors. You will send this each week on the afternoon of your Rally Session.

Give a recap of your Rally Session:
• Tell who the speaker was and give a quote from the speaker. If a video was taken, embed the video as well.
• List your top producers of the week, along with their company and team.
• Give the name of the top producing team of the week, along with the Team Captain and team members.
• Announce any special incentives for the upcoming week.
• If there are any sponsorships you are pushing for the coming week, list them and link to the descriptions of them on your TRC website.

Through this, you are promoting those individuals who performed well with their sales and encouraging those who didn’t to do better in the upcoming week. You are also providing anyone who couldn’t attend the Session with information about what is happening in the coming week. "
TRC Management,Print Rewards Report & incentive checks ,Chamber Staff,Print the Rewards Report from the YGM online system.

TRC Events,Send Rally Session #6 reminder ,Chamber Staff,"Send an email reminder to all your volunteers the day before the Rally Session. You will be doing this on an on-going basis before each Rally Session.

This reminder is NOT to secure RSVP counts for food (while those do assist with a more accurate number). This activity is a gentle reminder of the meeting with a ""hope to see you there"" - not a ""we are about to order food; are you coming?"".

These should be crafted in such a way as to make your volunteers feel as if they would be missing out if they didn’t attend, not as if they would be scolded for missing. These are encouraged but not required. We want your volunteers to enjoy attending Rally Sessions and to leave feeling as if they have learned something new and gained valuable information to help their personal TRC sales.

History shows campaigns in which these meetings are held are more likely to reach or exceed goal.

During these meetings, you want each Team Captain to have a list from their team members of who they have contacted and what sponsorships and prospects that are currently working on. These specifics will let you know if any volunteers are working the same companies or sponsorships. It will also let you know if there are companies in your membership that haven’t been contacted and who you feel should be approached. It will also let you know if there are sponsorships that aren’t selling as quickly as you had hoped.

TRC Management,Report TRC progress #1,Chamber Staff,"To ensure that no CEO/business owner is left in an awkward position due to the lack of participation of their team, Team Captain, or volunteer, periodic reports should be provided to them. These reports make certain everyone is aware of volunteer productivity.

If volunteers and teams are doing a great job, send a screenshot of the team standing with a note congratulating the team and ask for the CEO/business owner’s help in sharing that congratulations.

If the volunteer or team isn’t doing as well (or hasn’t done anything thus far), send a screenshot of the team standing saying you wanted to make the CEO/business owner aware of the team progress. Nothing more needs to be said. Never point out that the team isn’t performing to expectations. The CEO/business owner can determine that on their own.

TRC Events,Plan Victory Party agenda ,Chamber Staff,"This is a celebration of your success – the success of the TRC, your chamber, the TRC leadership, and your volunteers. The focus should be on everyone’s accomplishments. The agenda should be very short – no more than 10 minutes – with the remainder of the time free for people to network and enjoy themselves.

The Victory Party is an excellent event to invite sponsors. Those volunteers who sold to the sponsors can use this as an additional business networking opportunity. You should also plan to invite your Board of Directors, any CEO/business owners of campaign volunteers, and the media.

DO NOT hand out checks or make trip announcements at this event, especially if the media or sponsors are attending. Those items of business may be handled at another time. This is about the campaign as a whole and how it positively benefitted the chamber, the member businesses, and the volunteers.

Wrap-Up,Survey Volunteers ,Chamber Staff,"Your volunteers are your most valuable resource in a TRC. Knowing what motivated them, what challenges they faced, and what they gained from their involvement is vital information for your next TRC. The best way to gather this information is through surveys.

In the selection of possible questions to use in an email survey, select the ones that matter the most to you and your chamber. There is a Standard Survey and a Creative Survey. For optimal returns, select no more than 10 questions.

The easiest way to handle this is to send these via an online system such as Constant Contact or Survey Monkey. These services automatically compile results for you."
Wrap-Up,Schedule Focus Groups ,"YGM, Chamber Staff","You'll want to meet with some of your top performers to thank them for their involvement in the TRC. This is also a good time to ask them for some of their best tips for producing. You can use these tips for other volunteers in years to come.

A YGM representative will conduct these meetings and will provide you with input from the focus groups. YGM will meet with staff, Team Captains, and top performing volunteers."
Incentives-Trip,Create closed Facebook group for TRC Trip,Chamber Staff,"After the TRC is concluded, be sure to keep the energy high for those volunteers who earned the TRC trip. Use the Closed Facebook Trip Group to distribute information – passports needed, for instance – and be sure to provide them with that information in plenty of time for them to secure whatever is needed. Plan to use the group for a mix of important information and fun. You will also be able to share fun information about the trip location and generate excitement about the trip. They will be able to begin to interact with one another and build that bond with one another through this group page. It’s an excellent place to share photos during and after the trip as well."
Wrap-Up,Present TRC review to staff,,"After assessing the TRC, reviewing the Volunteer surveys, conducting the Focus Groups and preparing a general overview of what you hope for your next year's TRC, present a comprehensive review of this year's campaign along with a plan for growth next year to your staff. Ask for their input.

YGM recommends reviewing each of your programs, initiatives, and events through the year as they occur and making notes as to what worked best, what could be tweaked, what sponsorships sold and what didn’t, and what sponsorships might lend themselves to a cost increase or decrease."
Wrap-Up,Present TRC review & future plans to BOD ,"Chair, Chamber Staff","A TRC is best utilized when seen as a continuous strategic planning tool.

Be clear in the successes and challenges you faced with the campaign as well as a plan for growth next year. Also, be sure to focus on how the TRC is an on-going strategic planning tool and detail how your staff will use it as such. "
